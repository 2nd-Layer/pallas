# Pallas

Rust-native building blocks for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.

## Introduction

Pallas is an expanding collection of modules that re-implements common
Cardano logic in native Rust. This crate doesn't provide any particular
application, it is meant to be used as a base layer to facilitate the
development of higher-level use-cases, such as explorers, wallets, etc (who
knows, maybe even a full node in the far away future).

## Etymology

> Pallas: (Greek mythology) goddess of wisdom and useful arts and prudent warfare;
